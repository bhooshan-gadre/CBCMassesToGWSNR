# CBCMassesToGWSNR
To study effect of CBC mass distribution on GW signal SNR

- **_function_SNR.py_**
	- Module containing definitions of functions to calculate SNRs (simple-dependent only on component masses and distance from source; detailed- containing all the info like sky location and orintation etc.)
	- Reads the ASD data and Antenna sensitivity to sky location data
	- Prforms 1D and 2D interpolation functions of F+, Fx and ASD
	- Contains all the necessary constants
	
- **_Limits_on_visible_space.py_**
